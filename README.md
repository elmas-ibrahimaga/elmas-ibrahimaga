### Hi there 👋 I'm Elmas İbrahimağa

💡 I'm an engineer who sees the big picture — not just writing code, but building workflows, organizing teams, and making things actually work.

I work across:
- 🧠 **Data**
- ⚙️ **DevOps**
- 🗂 **Project structure**
- 📋 **Program management**

---

### 🔥 What I Actually Do (And Love Doing)

- 📊 Build clear dashboards that track 30+ people across countries — used to improve real team planning and program impact  
- 🐳 Set up automation pipelines using Docker, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD tools  
- ⚡ Manage real-time data flows using Kafka, Spark, and Jupyter  
- 📈 Organize complex data into something teams can actually use  
- 🧭 Blend management thinking with engineering execution

### 💭 What I Believe

Every challenge has a way forward — I believe problems are just **unfinished solutions**. That mindset helps me stay calm, dig deeper, and actually get things done.

### 🧠 Currently Exploring

- **Power BI**, **Airflow**, and modern data tools  
- **Chinese (HSK 2+)** and preparing for **TOEFL**  
- Real-world health & social impact projects with data + strategy

🧩 I love connecting people, logic, and purpose. I’m happiest when I’m making messy things simple and real ideas work.
